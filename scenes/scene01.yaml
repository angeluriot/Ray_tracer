# This is an example scene description for the raytracer framework created
# for the Computer Science course "Introduction to Computer Graphics"
# taught at the University of Groningen by Tobias Isenberg.
#
# The scene description format we use is based on YAML, which is a human friendly
# data serialization standard. This gives us a flexible format which should be
# fairly easy to make both backward and forward compatible (i.e., by ignoring
# unknown directives). In addition parsers are available for many languages.
# See http://www.yaml.org/ for more information on YAML.
#
# The example scene description should largely speak for itself. By now
# it should be clear that the #-character can be used to insert comments.
